	abstract     = {Neuroscience employs diverse neuroimaging techniques, each offering distinct insights into brain activity, from electrophysiological recordings such as EEG, which have high temporal resolution, to hemodynamic modalities such as fMRI, which have increased spatial precision. However, integrating these heterogeneous data sources remains a challenge, which limits a comprehensive understanding of brain function. We present the Spatiotemporal Alignment of Multimodal Brain Activity (SAMBA) framework, which bridges the spatial and temporal resolution gaps across modalities by learning a unified latent space free of modality-specific biases. SAMBA introduces a novel attention-based wavelet decomposition for spectral filtering of electrophysiological recordings, graph attention networks to model functional connectivity between functional brain units, and recurrent layers to capture temporal autocorrelations in brain signal. We show that the training of SAMBA, aside from achieving translation, also learns a rich representation of brain information processing. We showcase this classify external stimuli driving brain activity from the representation learned in hidden layers of SAMBA, paving the way for broad downstream applications in neuroscience research and clinical contexts.},

	abstract     = {In diverse fields of application, Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been proposed to find the optimum of black-box functions, surpassing human-driven searches. BO's appeal lies in its data efficiency, making it suitable for optimizing costly-to-evaluate functions without requiring extensive training data. While BO can perform well in closed-loop, domain experts frequently have hypotheses about which parameter combinations are more likely to yield optimal results. Hence, for BO to be truly relevant and adopted by practitioners, such prior knowledge needs to be efficiently and seamlessly integrated into the optimization framework. Some methods were recently developed to address this challenge, but they suffer from robustness issues when provided erroneous insight. Building on the idea of element-wise prior-weighted acquisition function, we propose to use a fixed-weight effective prior that distills expert user knowledge with minimal computational cost. Comprehensive investigation across diverse task conditions and prior quality levels revealed that our method, \ensuremath{\alpha}-\ensuremath{\pi}BO, surpasses Vanilla BO when provided with insights of good quality while maintaining robustness against misleading information. Moreover, unlike other methods, \ensuremath{\alpha}-\ensuremath{\pi}BO typically requires no hyperparameter tuning, largely simplifying its implementation in diverse tasks.},

	abstract     = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to restore and enhance a wide range of human capabilities. However, a barrier to the adoption of BCIs is how long it can take users to learn to control them. We hypothesized that human BCI learning could be accelerated by leveraging the naturally occurring geometric structure of brain activity, or its intrinsic manifold, extracted using a data-diffusion process. We trained participants on a noninvasive BCI that allowed them to gain real-time control of an avatar in a virtual reality game by modulating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity in brain regions that support spatial navigation. We then perturbed the mapping between fMRI activity patterns and the movement of the avatar to test our manifold hypothesis. When the new mapping respected the intrinsic manifold, participants succeeded in regaining control of the BCI by aligning their brain activity within the manifold. When the new mapping sdid not respect the intrinsic manifold, participants could not learn to control the avatar again. These findings show that the manifold geometry of brain activity constrains human learning of a complex cognitive task in higher-order brain regions. Manifold geometry may be a critical ingredient for unlocking the potential of future human neurotechnologies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

While there are many hypotheses as to how classical psychedelics could induce these effects, there are no concrete mechanistic models that capture the variety of observed effects in humans, while remaining consistent with the known pharmacological effects of classical psychedelics on neural circuits. In this work, we propose the {\textquotedblleft}oneirogen hypothesis{\textquotedblright}, which posits that the perceptual effects of classical psychedelics are a result of their pharmacological actions inducing neural activity states that truly are more similar to dream-like states. We simulate classical psychedelics{\textquoteright} effects via manipulating neural network models trained on perceptual tasks with the Wake-Sleep algorithm. This established machine learning algorithm leverages two activity phases, a perceptual phase (wake) where sensory inputs are encoded, and a generative phase (dream) where the network internally generates activity consistent with stimulus-evoked responses. We simulate the action of psychedelics by partially shifting the model to the {\textquoteleft}Sleep{\textquoteright} state, which entails a greater influence of top-down connections, in line with the impact of psychedelics on apical dendrites. The effects resulting from this manipulation capture a number of experimentally observed phenomena including the emergence of hallucinations, increases in stimulus-conditioned variability, and large increases in synaptic plasticity. We further provide a number of testable predictions which could be used to validate or invalidate our oneirogen hypothesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

The ultimate goal of this process is to produce neural dynamics that enable the rich repertoire of behaviors we perform with our limbs. What begins as a series of {\textquotedblleft}babbles{\textquotedblright} coalesces into skilled motor output as the brain rapidly learns to control the body. However, the nature of the teaching signal underlying this normative learning process remains elusive. Here, we test two well-established and biologically plausible theories{\textemdash}supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL){\textemdash}that could explain how neural circuits develop the capacity for skilled movements. We trained recurrent neural networks to control a biomechanical model of a primate arm using either SL or RL and compared the resulting neural dynamics to populations of neurons recorded from the motor cortex of monkeys performing the same movements. Intriguingly, only RL-trained networks produced neural activity that matched their biological counterparts in terms of both the geometry and dynamics of population activity. We show that the similarity between RL-trained networks and biological brains depends critically on matching biomechanical properties of the limb. We then demonstrated that monkeys and RL-trained networks, but not SL-trained networks, show a strikingly similar capacity for robust short-term behavioral adaptation to a movement perturbation, indicating a fundamental and general commonality in the neural control policy. Together, our results support the hypothesis that neural dynamics for behavioral control emerge through a process akin to reinforcement learning. The resulting neural circuits offer numerous advantages for adaptable behavioral control over simpler and more efficient learning rules and expand our understanding of how developmental processes shape neural dynamics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract     = {Neurons in the brain have rich and adaptive input-output properties. Features such as heterogeneous f-I curves and spike frequency adaptation are known to place single neurons in optimal coding regimes when facing changing stimuli. Yet, it is still unclear how brain circuits exploit single-neuron flexibility, and how network-level requirements may have shaped such cellular function. To answer this question, a multi-scaled approach is needed where the computations of single neurons and neural circuits must be considered as a complete system. In this work, we use artificial neural networks to systematically investigate single-neuron input-output adaptive mechanisms, optimized in an end-to-end fashion. Throughout the optimization process, each neuron has the liberty to modify its nonlinear activation function parametrized to mimic f-I curves of biological neurons, either by learning an individual static function or via a learned and shared adaptation mechanism to modify activation functions in real-time during a task. We find that such adaptive networks show much-improved robustness to noise and changes in input statistics. Using tools from dynamical systems theory, we analyze the role of these emergent single-neuron properties and argue that neural diversity and adaptation play an active regularization role, enabling neural circuits to optimally propagate information across time. Finally, we outline similarities between these optimized solutions and known coding strategies found in biological neurons, such as gain scaling and fractional order differentiation/integration.},

The advantage of GD is that it is effective at learning difficult tasks. However, it produces ANNs that are a poor phenomenological fit to biology, making them less relevant as models of the brain. Specifically, it violates Dale{\textquoteright}s law, by allowing synapses to change from excitatory to inhibitory, and leads to synaptic weights that are not log-normally distributed, contradicting experimental data. Here, starting from first principles of optimisation theory, we present an alternative learning algorithm, exponentiated gradient (EG), that respects Dale{\textquoteright}s Law and produces log-normal weights, without losing the power of learning with gradients. We also show that in biologically relevant settings EG outperforms GD, including learning from sparsely relevant signals and dealing with synaptic pruning.

	abstract     = {Dense functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets open new avenues to create auto-regressive models of brain activity. Individual idiosyncrasies are obscured by group models, but can be captured by purely individual models given sufficient amounts of training data. In this study, we compared several deep and shallow individual models on the temporal auto-regression of BOLD time-series recorded during a natural video-watching task. The best performing models were then analyzed in terms of their data requirements and scaling, subject specificity, and the space-time structure of their predicted dynamics. We found the Chebnets, a type of graph convolutional neural network, to be best suited for temporal BOLD auto-regression, closely followed by linear models. Chebnets demonstrated an increase in performance with increasing amounts of data, with no complete saturation at 9 h of training data. Good generalization to other kinds of video stimuli and to resting-state data marked the Chebnets' ability to capture intrinsic brain dynamics rather than only stimulus-specific autocorrelation patterns. Significant subject specificity was found at short prediction time lags. The Chebnets were found to capture lower frequencies at longer prediction time lags, and the spatial correlations in predicted dynamics were found to match traditional functional connectivity networks. Overall, these results demonstrate that large individual functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets can be used to efficiently train purely individual auto-regressive models of brain activity, and that massive amounts of individual data are required to do so. The excellent performance of the Chebnets likely reflects their ability to combine spatial and temporal interactions on large time scales at a low complexity cost. The non-linearities of the models did not appear as a key advantage. In fact, surprisingly, linear versions of the Chebnets appeared to outperform the original non-linear ones. Individual temporal auto-regressive models have the potential to improve the predictability of the BOLD signal. This study is based on a massive, publicly-available dataset, which can serve for future benchmarks of individual auto-regressive modeling.},

We investigated how task assistance influences learned neural representations using Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), which map neural activity into movement via a decoder. We analyzed motor cortex activity as monkeys practiced BCI with a decoder that adapted to improve or maintain performance over days. Over time, task-relevant information became concentrated in fewer neurons, unlike with fixed decoders. At the population level, task information also became largely confined to a few neural modes that accounted for an unexpectedly small fraction of the population variance. A neural network model suggests the adaptive decoders directly contribute to forming these more compact neural representations. Our findings show that assistive decoders manipulate error information used for long-term learning computations like credit assignment, which informs our understanding of motor learning and has implications for designing real-world BCIs.Competing Interest StatementA.L.O. is a scientific advisor for Meta Reality Labs.

	abstract     = {Objective. In bioelectronic medicine, neuromodulation therapies induce neural signals to the brain or organs, modifying their function. Stimulation devices capable of triggering exogenous neural signals using electrical waveforms require a complex and multi-dimensional parameter space to control such waveforms. Determining the best combination of parameters (waveform optimization or dosing) for treating a particular patient's illness is therefore challenging. Comprehensive parameter searching for an optimal stimulation effect is often infeasible in a clinical setting due to the size of the parameter space. Restricting this space, however, may lead to suboptimal therapeutic results, reduced responder rates, and adverse effects. Approach. As an alternative to a full parameter search, we present a flexible machine learning, data acquisition, and processing framework for optimizing neural stimulation parameters, requiring as few steps as possible using Bayesian optimization. This optimization builds a model of the neural and physiological responses to stimulations, enabling it to optimize stimulation parameters and provide estimates of the accuracy of the response model. The vagus nerve (VN) innervates, among other thoracic and visceral organs, the heart, thus controlling heart rate (HR), making it an ideal candidate for demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Main results. The efficacy of our optimization approach was first evaluated on simulated neural responses, then applied to VN stimulation intraoperatively in porcine subjects. Optimization converged quickly on parameters achieving target HRs and optimizing neural B-fiber activations despite high intersubject variability. Significance. An optimized stimulation waveform was achieved in real time with far fewer stimulations than required by alternative optimization strategies, thus minimizing exposure to side effects. Uncertainty estimates helped avoiding stimulations outside a safe range. Our approach shows that a complex set of neural stimulation parameters can be optimized in real-time for a patient to achieve a personalized precision dosing.},

	abstract     = {Objective. Neurostimulation is emerging as treatment for several diseases of the brain and peripheral organs. Due to variability arising from placement of stimulation devices, underlying neuroanatomy and physiological responses to stimulation, it is essential that neurostimulation protocols are personalized to maximize efficacy and safety. Building such personalized protocols would benefit from accumulated information in increasingly large datasets of other individuals' responses. Approach. To address that need, we propose a meta-learning family of algorithms to conduct few-shot optimization of key fitting parameters of physiological and neural responses in new individuals. While our method is agnostic to neurostimulation setting, here we demonstrate its effectiveness on the problem of physiological modeling of fiber recruitment during vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Using data from acute VNS experiments, the mapping between amplitudes of stimulus-evoked compound action potentials (eCAPs) and physiological responses, such as heart rate and breathing interval modulation, is inferred. Main results. Using additional synthetic data sets to complement experimental results, we demonstrate that our meta-learning framework is capable of directly modeling the physiology-eCAP relationship for individual subjects with much fewer individually queried data points than standard methods. Significance. Our meta-learning framework is general and can be adapted to many input–response neurostimulation mapping problems. Moreover, this method leverages information from growing data sets of past patients, as a treatment is deployed. It can also be combined with several model types, including regression, Gaussian processes with Bayesian optimization, and beyond.},

The problem of ineffability, in particular, is a longstanding issue in philosophy that partly motivates the explanatory gap: the belief that consciousness cannot be reduced to underlying physical processes. Here, we provide an information theoretic dynamical systems perspective on the richness and ineffability of consciousness. In our framework, the richness of conscious experience corresponds to the amount of information in a conscious state and ineffability corresponds to the amount of information lost at different stages of processing. We describe how attractor dynamics in working memory would induce impoverished recollections of our original experiences, how the discrete symbolic nature of language is insufficient for describing the rich and high-dimensional structure of experiences, and how similarity in the cognitive function of two individuals relates to improved communicability of their experiences to each other. While our model may not settle all questions relating to the explanatory gap, it makes progress toward a fully physicalist explanation of the richness and ineffability of conscious experience--two important aspects that seem to be part of what makes qualitative character so puzzling.},

In this study, we build on recent work exploring how CL might be implemented by biological or neurmorphic systems and show that this form of learning can be made temporally local, and can still function even if many of the dynamical requirements of standard training procedures are relaxed. Thanks to a set of general theorems corroborated by numerical experiments across several CL models, our results provide theoretical foundations for the study and development of CL methods for biological and neuromorphic neural networks.},

However, they have been excluded from clinical trials of intracortical brain-computer interface to date.

We first review the technical hardware and software considerations for the application of intracortical brain-computer interface in children. We then discuss ethical issues related to motor brain-computer interface use in pediatric neurosurgery. Finally, based on the input of a multidisciplinary panel of experts in fields related to brain-computer interface (functional and restorative neurosurgery, pediatric neurosurgery, mathematics and artificial intelligence research, neuroengineering, pediatric ethics, and pragmatic ethics), we then formulate initial recommendations regarding the clinical use of invasive brain-computer interfaces in children.},

	abstract     = {Neural activity tends to reside on manifolds whose dimension is lower than the dimension of the whole neural state space. Experiments using brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) with microelectrode arrays implanted in the motor cortex of nonhuman primates have provided ways to test whether neural manifolds influence learning-related neural computations. Starting from a learned BCI-controlled motor task, these experiments explored the effect of changing the BCI decoder to implement perturbations that were either {\textquotedblleft}aligned{\textquotedblright} or not with the pre-existing neural manifold. In a series of studies, researchers found that within-manifold perturbations (WMPs) evoked fast reassociations of existing neural patterns for rapid adaptation, while outside-manifold perturbations (OMPs) triggered a slower adaptation process that led to the emergence of new neural patterns. Together, these findings have been interpreted as suggesting that these different rates of adaptation might be associated with distinct learning mechanisms. Here, we investigated whether gradient-descent learning could alone explain these differences. Using an idealized model that captures the fixed-point dynamics of recurrent neural networks, we uncovered gradient-based learning dynamics consistent with experimental findings. Crucially, this experimental match arose only when the network was initialized in a lazier learning regime, a concept inherited from deep learning theory. A lazy learning regime{\textemdash}in contrast with a rich regime{\textemdash}implies small changes on synaptic strengths throughout learning. For OMPs, these small changes were less effective at increasing performance and could lead to unstable adaptation with a heightened sensitivity to learning rates. For WMPs, they helped reproduce the reassociation mechanism on short adaptation time scales, especially with large input variances. Since gradient descent has many biologically plausible variants, our findings establish lazy gradient-based learning as a plausible mechanism for adaptation under network-level constraints and unify several experimental results from the literature.Competing Interest StatementALO is a scientific advisor for Meta Reality Labs.

How species differ in terms of neural circuits and whether inter-species differences in neural circuit organization conform to these taxonomies is unknown. The main obstacle to the comparison of neural architectures has been differences in network reconstruction techniques, yielding species-specific connectomes that are not directly comparable to one another. Here, we comprehensively chart connectome organization across the mammalian phylogenetic spectrum using a common reconstruction protocol. We analyse the mammalian MRI (MaMI) data set, a database that encompasses high-resolution ex vivo structural and diffusion MRI scans of 124 species across 12 taxonomic orders and 5 superorders, collected using a unified MRI protocol. We assess similarity between species connectomes using two methods: similarity of Laplacian eigenspectra and similarity of multiscale topological features. We find greater inter-species similarities among species within the same taxonomic order, suggesting that connectome organization reflects established taxonomic relationships defined by morphology and genetics. While all connectomes retain hallmark global features and relative proportions of connection classes, inter-species variation is driven by local regional connectivity profiles. By encoding connectomes into a common frame of reference, these findings establish a foundation for investigating how neural circuits change over phylogeny, forging a link from genes to circuits to behaviour.},

We assume that stimulus-driven responses share latent features common across subjects that are jointly discoverable. Previous approaches to this problem have relied on linear methods like principal component analysis and shared response modeling. We propose a neural network called MRMD-AE (manifold-regularized multiple- decoder, autoencoder) that learns a common embedding from multi-subject fMRI data while retaining the ability to decode individual responses. Our latent common space represents an extensible manifold (where untrained data can be mapped) and improves classification accuracy of stimulus features of unseen timepoints, as well as cross-subject translation of fMRI signals.},

The more commonly studied aspect of this phenomenon corresponds to <em>model-wise</em> double descent where the test error exhibits a second descent with increasing model complexity, beyond the classical U-shaped error curve. In this work, we investigate the origins of the less studied <em>epoch-wise</em> double descent in which the test error undergoes two non-monotonous transitions, or descents as the training time increases. We study a linear teacher-student setup exhibiting epoch-wise double descent similar to that in deep neural networks. In this setting, we derive closed-form analytical expressions describing the generalization error in terms of low-dimensional scalar macroscopic variables. We find that double descent can be attributed to distinct features being learned at different scales: as fast-learning features overfit, slower-learning features start to fit, resulting in a second descent in test error. We validate our findings through numerical simulations where our theory accurately predicts empirical findings and remains consistent with observations in deep neural networks.},

	abstract     = {Finding the right amount of deliberation, between insufficient and excessive, is a hard decision making problem that depends on the value we place on our time. Average-reward, putatively encoded by tonic dopamine, serves in existing reinforcement learning theory as the opportunity cost of time, including deliberation time. Importantly, this cost can itself vary with the environmental context and is not trivial to estimate. Here, we propose how the opportunity cost of deliberation can be estimated adaptively on multiple timescales to account for non-stationary contextual factors. We use it in a simple decision-making heuristic based on average-reward reinforcement learning (AR-RL) that we call Performance-Gated Deliberation (PGD). We propose PGD as a strategy used by animals wherein deliberation cost is implemented directly as urgency, a previously characterized neural signal effectively controlling the speed of the decision-making process. We show PGD outperforms AR-RL solutions in explaining behaviour and urgency of non-human primates in a context-varying random walk prediction task and is consistent with relative performance and urgency in a context-varying random dot motion task. We make readily testable predictions for both neural activity and behaviour.},

Further, in many cases the target entities for analysis are actually signals on such graphs. We propose to compare and organize such datasets of graph signals by using an earth mover's distance (EMD) with a geodesic cost over the underlying graph. Typically, EMD is computed by optimizing over the cost of transporting one probability distribution to another over an underlying metric space. However, this is inefficient when computing the EMD between many signals. Here, we propose an unbalanced graph EMD that efficiently embeds the unbalanced EMD on an underlying graph into an L1 space, whose metric we call unbalanced diffusion earth mover's distance (UDEMD). Next, we show how this gives distances between graph signals that are robust to noise. Finally, we apply this to organizing patients based on clinical notes, embedding cells modeled as signals on a gene graph, and organizing genes modeled as signals over a large cell graph. In each case, we show that UDEMD-based embeddings find accurate distances that are highly efficient compared to other methods.},

This suggests that qualitative and quantitative examination of the loss landscape geometry could yield insights about neural network generalization performance during training. To this end, researchers have proposed visualizing the loss landscape through the use of simple dimensionality reduction techniques. However, such visualization methods have been limited by their linear nature and only capture features in one or two dimensions, thus restricting sampling of the loss landscape to lines or planes. Here, we expand and improve upon these in three ways. First, we present a novel ``jump and retrain'' procedure for sampling relevant portions of the loss landscape. We show that the resulting sampled data holds more meaningful information about the network's ability to generalize. Next, we show that non-linear dimensionality reduction of the jump and retrain trajectories via PHATE, a trajectory and manifold-preserving method, allows us to visualize differences between networks that are generalizing well vs poorly. Finally, we combine PHATE trajectories with a computational homology characterization to quantify trajectory differences.},

	abstract     = {<p>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been successfully applied to a variety of problems involving sequential data, but their optimization is sensitive to parameter initialization, architecture, and optimizer hyperparameters. Considering RNNs as dynamical systems, a natural way to capture stability, i.e., the growth and decay over long iterates, are the Lyapunov Exponents (LEs), which form the Lyapunov spectrum. The LEs have a bearing on stability of RNN training dynamics since forward propagation of information is related to the backward propagation of error gradients. LEs measure the asymptotic rates of expansion and contraction of non-linear system trajectories, and generalize stability analysis to the time-varying attractors structuring the non-autonomous dynamics of data-driven RNNs. As a tool to understand and exploit stability of training dynamics, the Lyapunov spectrum fills an existing gap between prescriptive mathematical approaches of limited scope and computationally-expensive empirical approaches. To leverage this tool, we implement an efficient way to compute LEs for RNNs during training, discuss the aspects specific to standard RNN architectures driven by typical sequential datasets, and show that the Lyapunov spectrum can serve as a robust readout of training stability across hyperparameters. With this exposition-oriented contribution, we hope to draw attention to this under-studied, but theoretically grounded tool for understanding training stability in RNNs.</p>},

	abstract     = {Many natural systems, especially biological ones, exhibit complex multivariate nonlinear dynamical behaviors that can be hard to capture by linear autoregressive models. On the other hand, generic nonlinear models such as deep recurrent neural networks often require large amounts of training data, not always available in domains such as brain imaging; also, they often lack interpretability. Domain knowledge about the types of dynamics typically observed in such systems, such as a certain type of dynamical systems models, could complement purely data-driven techniques by providing a good prior. In this work, we consider a class of ordinary differential equation (ODE) models known as van der Pol (VDP) oscil lators and evaluate their ability to capture a low-dimensional representation of neural activity measured by different brain imaging modalities, such as calcium imaging (CaI) and fMRI, in different living organisms: larval zebrafish, rat, and human. We develop a novel and efficient approach to the nontrivial problem of parameters estimation for a network of coupled dynamical systems from multivariate data and demonstrate that the resulting VDP models are both accurate and interpretable, as VDP's coupling matrix reveals anatomically meaningful excitatory and inhibitory interactions across different brain subsystems. VDP outperforms linear autoregressive models (VAR) in terms of both the data fit accuracy and the quality of insight provided by the coupling matrices and often tends to generalize better to unseen data when predicting future brain activity, being comparable to and sometimes better than the recurrent neural networks (LSTMs). Finally, we demonstrate that our (generative) VDP model can also serve as a data-augmentation tool leading to marked improvements in predictive accuracy of recurrent neural networks. Thus, our work contributes to both basic and applied dimensions of neuroimaging: gaining scientific insights and improving brain-based predictive models, an area of potentially high practical importance in clinical diagnosis and neurotechnology.},

In this work, we introduce PNS-GAN, a generative adversarial network capable of producing realistic nerve recordings conditioned on physiological biomarkers. PNS-GAN operates in the wavelet domain to preserve both the timing and frequency of neural events with high resolution. PNS-GAN generates sequences of scaleograms from noise using a recurrent neural network and 2D transposed convolution layers. PNS-GAN discriminates over stacks of scaleograms with a network of 3D convolution layers. We find that our generated signal reproduces a number of characteristics of the real signal, including similarity in a canonical time-series feature-space, and contains physiologically related neural events including respiration modulation and similar distributions of afferent and efferent signalling.},

We highlight a regularization effect induced by a dynamical alignment ofthe neural tangent features introduced by Jacot et al. (2018), along a small number of task-relevant directions. This can be interpreted as a combined mechanism of feature selection and compression. By extrapolating a new analysis of Rademacher complexity bounds for linear models, we motivate and study a heuristic complexity measure that captures this phenomenon, in terms of sequences of tangent kernel classes along optimization paths.

Top-down signals consist of beliefs and expectations based on past experience and the current reportable short-term memory, such as how the phrase `peanut butter and ...' will be completed. The optimal combination of bottom-up and top-down information remains an open question, but the manner of combination must be dynamic and both context and task dependent. To effectively utilize the wealth of potential top-down information available, and to prevent the cacophony of intermixed signals in a bidirectional architecture, mechanisms are needed to restrict information flow. We explore deep recurrent neural net architectures in which bottom-up and top-down signals are dynamically combined using attention. Modularity of the architecture further restricts the sharing and communication of information. Together, attention and modularity direct information flow, which leads to reliable performance improvements in perceptual and language tasks, and in particular improves robustness to distractions and noisy data. We demonstrate on a variety of benchmarks in language modeling, sequential image classification, video prediction and reinforcement learning that the \emph{bidirectional} information flow can improve results over strong baselines.},

It serves as a crucial experimental tool to probe computation in neural circuits, and has applications in neuroprostheses used to aid recovery of motor function after stroke or injury to the nervous system. There are two important challenges when designing algorithms to unveil and control neurostimulation-to-motor correspondences, thereby linking spatiotemporal patterns of neural stimulation to muscle activation: (1) the exploration of motor maps needs to be fast and efficient (exhaustive search is to be avoided for clinical and experimental reasons) (2) online learning needs to be flexible enough to deal with noise and occasional spurious responses. We propose a stimulation search algorithm to address these issues, and demonstrate its efficacy with experiments in the motor cortex (M1) of a non-human primate model. Our solution is a novel iterative process using Bayesian Optimization via Gaussian Processes on a hierarchy of increasingly complex signal spaces. We show that our algorithm can successfully and rapidly learn correspondences between complex stimulation patterns and evoked muscle activation patterns, where standard approaches fail. Importantly, we uncover nonlinear circuit-level computations in M1 that would have been difficult to identify using conventional mapping techniques.},

We observe that internal representations develop a task-relevant structure as soon as significant information is provided as input and this structure remains for some time even if we let the dynamics drift. However, the structure is only interpretable by the final classifying layer at the fixed time step for which the network was trained. We measure that throughout the training, the recurrent weights matrix is modified so that the resulting dynamical system associated with the network's neural activations evolves into a non-trivial attractor, reminiscent of neural oscillations in the brain. Our findings suggest that RNNs change their internal dynamics throughout training so that information is stored in low-dimensional cycles, rather than in high-dimensional clusters.},

Here, we characterize the effects of anodal and cathodal tDCS on underlying neurons in active macaque sensorimotor cortex across a range of doses. We find changes in spike rates that are sensitive to both current intensity and polarity, behavioral state, and that are cell-type specific. At high currents, effects persist after the offset of stimulation, and the spatiotemporal activity associated with motor activity of the contralateral limb, measured by dynamics of neural ensembles, are altered. These data suggest that tDCS induces reproducible and noticeable changes in cortical neuron activity and support the theory that it affects brain activity through a combination of single neuron polarization and network interactions.},
